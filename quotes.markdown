I enjoy collecting quotes. It helps me in distressing situations. I usually tell the apt quote for any situation. And at times it is difficult for me to remember all of those.

I collect the quotes in Google Keep or take a screenshot.

### Favourite Quotes

> Don't focus on the end result, enjoy the journey !!

> Nothing is impossible, try harder !!

> Okay. Carolyn, you are the star of a movie. This is the part of the movie where you get your heart broken. Where the world tests you, and people treat you like shit. But it has to happen this way. Otherwise, the end of the movie, when you get everything you want, won’t feel as rewarding. There are assholes out there, but in the end, they don’t matter. Because this movie’s not about them. It’s never been about them.”

> Money doesn't make you wealthy. It makes you rich, but not wealthy !

> "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger!" - _Friedrich Nietzsche_

> Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.

> How do I not become an arsehole? Just try and stay honest. Cause once you start lying, it's very hard to stop. When you are young, you think that everybody out there really... really get you! But you know... actually only a handful of them do! All the people who like you, despite your faults. And then if you discard them, they will never come back! So when you meet those people, you just hold on to them...really, really tightly. And don't let them go!

> This is the advice from Adam’s mom: “You have to let the people you love know that you love them even if it causes you a great deal of pain.” When he asks why, she responds, “Because you’re alive."

> Happiest people aren't the ones who have the best of everything, they are the ones who make the best out of everything!

> Ambition is my fuel! And I get a great mileage!

> In times likes this one must be strong. Because the future belongs to those who are bold and not the doubters who are stuck in the past.

> Black holes are considered to be the hellmouths of the universe. Those who fall inside, disappear forever. But, where to? What is it that exists behind a black hole? What other things vanish there, along with space and time? Or, are space and time tied together as part of an endless cycle? What if everything from the past was actually influenced by the future?

> We are searching for the thread of Ariadne so that it can guide us on the right path and act as a beacon in the darkness. We would love to know what our fate will be, just where we are headed. But the truth is, that there is just one path through all times, predetermined by the beginning and by the end. Which is also the beginning.

> “And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.” – _Friedrich Nietzsche_

> Disappointments are the result of false expectations. Have hope and not expectations, then you might get a miracle and not disappointment!

> Isn't it peculiar that we feel the most repulsion for the people who are very much like ourselves?

> Man is a strange creature. All his actions are motivated by desire, his character forged by pain. As much as he may try to suppress that pain, to repress the desire, he cannot free himself from the eternal servitude to his feelings. For as long as the storm rages within him, he cannot find peace. Not in life, not in death. And so he will do what he must, day in, day out. The pain is his vessel, desire his compass. It is all that man is capable of.

> A man lives three lives. The first one ends with the loss of naivety, the second, with the loss of innocence and the third… with the loss of life itself. It’s inevitable that we go through all three stages.

> Have you heard of Master Zhuang’s paradox? ‘I dreamt I was a butterfly. Now I’ve woken up and I no longer know if I’m a person who dreamed he’s a butterfly or if I’m a butterfly who’s dreaming it’s a person.’

> Most people are nothing but pawns on a chessboard led by an unknown hand.

> Fate plays a cruel trick on us. And yet we'll always believe that there is a way to turn the tide in our favour, if we only wanted hard enough. Man is able to purse any goal no matter how unattainable it may seem, over the course of an entire lifetime. No resistance, no obstacle is great enough to stop the human will in its tracks. Isn't this stubbornness in our striving what distinguishes us from animals, that know only short term desire. And throughout the ages is not this unquenchable thirst at the heart of any progress that is ever made? No matter what motivates our will, it guides us on our path. We'll only be able to let go, once we have finally reached our goal.

I'm currently pursuing my B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering from PSG College of Technology, Coimbatore. I'm an ambivert. Anything related to security and hacking inspires me. I love programming & quotes. I keep all my stuff organized (trying to be a perfectionist). Movies, Series, Youtube, Books and Songs are my free time companions. Sometimes I do hangout with friends & play mobile or PC games too.
